# Introduction

- Predicting **continuous / quantitative** (numerical) output value => **Regression problem**
- Non-numerical values => **Categorical / Qualitative**
- **Clustering Problem ** => e.g. grouping individuals based on observed characteristics, there is no output variable to predict
- *Dimensions* => Traits / Attributes
- Statistical Learning (a subfield of Statistics) focuses on supervised and unsupervised modelling and prediction


#### Notation

- *n* => Sample Size (row)
- *p* => Number of variables (col)
- *x<sub>i,j</sub>* => Value of j<sup>th</sup> variable for the i<sup>th</sup> observation ( *i* = 1, 2, ..., *n* and *j* = 1, 2, ..., *p*)
- *y<sub>i</sub>* => i<sup>th</sup> observation of a variable on which prediction will be made
